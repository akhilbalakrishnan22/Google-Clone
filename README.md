This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
## Modules Used

- react

## What did I learn?

- To use Javascript fetch method to perform network request
- How to use built in react hooks useState and useEffect.
     - useState allows you to add state to your functional components.Using the useState hook inside a function component, you can create a piece of state without switching to class components.
     - useEffect is the combination of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount class lifecycle methods.It is ideal place to set up listeners, fetching data from API and removing listeners before the component is removed from the DOM.
- Use material ui for styling user interface.
- Use react context API to share data with multiple components, without having to pass data through props manually.
